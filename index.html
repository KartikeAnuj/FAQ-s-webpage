        <div class="question">86. In the Production Environment, all API services were producing “Runtime Error” and “500 Internal Server Error” as below Screenshot. What was the solution for this? </div>
        <div class="answer"> #As L1 team, we have to informed DevOps team related this issue. <br> : - There was a certificate issue. We have four deployments according to WSO2.
 
          Whenever we receive a certificate, in addition to implementing the SSL certificates, WSO2 also requires an additional step, which involves adding the certificate to the trust store.
          
          We must add it to the trust store, and furthermore, restart the V pods. While SSL certificates do not necessitate a pod restart.
          
          However, for this particular case, a trust store deployment restart is necessary, and this restart will affect two pods, specifically both Application manager gateway pods.
          
          This information will be valuable for future reference in similar situations involving SSL certificates and WSO2 deployments. Stressing the importance of adding the certificate to the trust store and restarting the relevant deployment.
